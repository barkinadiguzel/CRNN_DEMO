# ðŸ§  Simple CRNN OCR Model

A minimal and easy-to-understand **CRNN model** for character sequence recognition in **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** tasks.  
The model combines **CNN** for feature extraction and **BiLSTM (RNN)** for sequence modeling, with **CTC loss** for alignment-free training.

This project is intended as a learning demo and can be extended into more advanced OCR architectures.
